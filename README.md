# Welcome to NOSA

A Flat-Earth believer supported website that debunks actively uploaded images by NASA to their public databases.



I was tasked with building a website that used some sense of photo editing technology that catered to Flat earth believers while using the NASA api as my endpoint.  I decided to use current images of the earth sent from the daily image satellites, and allow you to debunk the image by pressing the NOSA button, which then flattens the image.



You can choose to print your newly debunked pic onto 1 of four templates; stickers, post cards, posters, or gift cards. You can also click through varying pre-existing text sayings that cater to the users' sense of humor.



The url endpoint can be refactored to have the app include other NASA images that include depictions of other planets, galaxies, and celestial bodies.



In order to run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.
